===================================================

1. Presentation

   mtcd is a very simple tool written with Qt 4.5 to 
   help telescope collimation. This tool creates circle
   sights by transparency on the background window.

2. Requirements

   mtcd just needs the standard Qt 4.5 libraries
   to work, on a modern windowed operating system, with
   a compositing window manager.

3. Usage

   Just launch mtcd, and place the window on the
   video of your mirrors throug your focuser, and
   adjust the circles

4. Build from sources

   You will need cmake, make, a c++ compiler with all
the c++ standard libraries, and the developpement version
of the Qt 4.5 (or above) libraries. You will also need the
developpement version of the libx11 composite extensions.

   To build from source use :

   >gzip -d mtcd_?.?.?_src.tar.gz
   >tar -xvf mtcd_?.?.?_src.tar
   >mkdir mtcd-build
   >cd mtcd-build
   >cmake ../mtcd_?.?.?_src/
   >make
   >sudo make install
